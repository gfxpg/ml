    "## Convolution layers\n",
    "\n",
    "A convolution layer accepts an input volume of size $I_H \\times I_W \\times I_D$ and produces an output volume of size $O_H \\times O_W \\times K$, where $K$ is the number of filters in the layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "A filter has a small width $F_W$ and height $F_H$ (such as $3\\times3$), but extends through the full depth of the input volume, $F_D = I_D$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output volume is produced by sliding each filter over the width and height of the input, moving one or several pixels (_stride_ $S$) at a time. With $S = 1$, the output volume has the same width and height as the input, provided $F_{H,W} \\mid I_{H,W}$. If the filter size does not evenly divide the input size, the latter can be padded with $P$ zeroes along the border to preserve dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each filter produces a _feature map_ -- a matrix with every element corresponding to an activation at a certain spatial position. Its dimensions depend on input size, filter size, stride, and padding, and can be determined as\n",

    "$$O_{H,W} = \\frac{I_{H,W} − F_{H,W} + 2P_{H,W}}{S_{H,W}} + 1$$\n",

    "One filter has $F_{H} \\times F_{W} \\times I_{D}$ weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Forward-pass computations\n",
    "\n",
    "A single element in the output volume is a dot product of a filter (third-order tensor) and a slice (third-order tensor) of the input value. Therefore, it takes $F_H \\times F_W \\times I_D$ fused multiply-add (FMA) operations to compute it.\n",
